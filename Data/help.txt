The server has a bunch of commands to try, you can call them using /command_name [args]:
- /help -> Shows this list of commands.
- /command1 [args] - returns a new list comprised of elements that on position i (0 <= i <= N) have the characters coresponding to the characters on position i from every starting element (args should be a list of strings). 
- /command2 [args] - returns the number of integers that are perfect squares, found in the arguments list (arg element should look like ab1cd5i)
- /command3 [args] - returns the sum of the arguments list after their digits are reversed (args should be a list of integers).
- /command4 [args] - returns the arithmetic mean of the elements that have the digit sum between the first 2 arguments (args should be a list of integers)
- /exit -> Exits the server.
